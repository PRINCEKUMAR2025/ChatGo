ChatGo is a software application designed to facilitate real-time communication between users or groups of users. It enables people to exchange text.

1. User Interface: A chat application typically features a user-friendly interface that includes a list of contacts or conversations on one side and the chat window on the other. Users can easily manage their conversations.

2. User Registration and Authentication: To use the application, users must register an account or sign in with their credentials (e.g., username, email) and a secure password.

3. Contact Management: Users can add contacts by searching for their usernames or phone numbers.

4. Real-Time Messaging: The core feature of a chat application is real-time messaging. Users can send text messages, emojis, stickers to individuals. Messages are delivered instantly and displayed in a conversation thread.

5. Notifications: The app provides push notifications to alert users of new messages, ensuring that they don't miss important updates even when the app is not active.

6. End-to-End Encryption: Security is a crucial concern in chat apps. Many apps offer end-to-end encryption, which ensures that only the sender and recipient can read the messages, making it difficult for third parties, including the service provider, to access the content.

7. Online/Offline Status: Chat applications often display the online or offline status of users, indicating whether they are currently active and available to chat. This status is typically represented by a colored banner below the user's profile picture or name.
Online: When a user is online, it means they are actively using the application and can receive messages and notifications in real-time. Their presence is indicated by a green banner.

8. Profile Picture: A profile picture, also known as an avatar or display picture (DP), is an image or visual representation chosen by the user to identify themselves on the chat application. This feature allows users to personalize their profiles and visually express their identity.
